# System-Analysis-and-Design <br />
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? <br />
DriverPass is a company started by Liam with the goal of helping people pass their driving test. Liam, the owner, plans to offer multiple packages of practice tests and behind-the-wheel training to prepare new drivers.. Students can schedule lessons online, over the phone, and in-person. After lessons the instructor can provide notes. <br /><br />

What did you do particularly well? <br />
I particularly liked a few of my diagrams. I would have liked more information in the interview we were given, especially about how they wanted the practice tests. <br /><br />

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? <br />
I would like to make more detailed diagrams. I would also revise the short essay from the first project. <br /><br />

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing? <br />
I try to make things simple. I try to limit my design to only what the user need. Adding fancy things can come later. If the system does not do what the user needs, they will find another system. <br /><br />

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? <br />
I like to keep things simple. I like using requirements, however I would probably us a format I was taught in a previous class assuming I didn’t have to follow a style guide.<br /><br />
